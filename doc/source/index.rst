IAI MovieBot equips with a scaleable structure for future amendments. It facilities the standardized components.
In specific, intent recognition in NLU identifies users' intent based on preferences and recognizes entities (movies and attributes) for users' utterances, NLG generates natural language responses based on templates, and dialogue policy in the dialogue manager adapts to the users' requirements in the conversation.
